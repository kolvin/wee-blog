My aim for this article is to share the **abstract concepts** that I've noticed as I've been responsible
for developing & shipping products.

In quick summary, containerization is the fucking shit and you should be using it everywhere!

### Abstract Concepts
- base image
- runtime configuration
- application dependencies
- runtime dependencies


##### 1. Base Image
Our base image will most likely be influenced by the target application's technical requirements.
IE;
- With a Symfony application, I would look into using php-fpm as my base image
- With a React, Vue application, I would look into using Node
- With a Springboot application, I would look into using a Java as my base image

So by understanding the applications runtime requirements, we are then able to start scaffolding the image and what OS flavor we use.


##### 2. Runtime Configuration



##### 3. Application Dependencies
Typically, tools like composer, npm, yarn, gem

##### 4. Runtime Dependencies
Typically, language extensions like php-xml
