My aim for this article is to share the **abstract concepts** that I've noticed as I've been responsible
for developing & shipping products.

In quick summary, containerization is the fucking shit and you should be using it everywhere!

### Abstract concepts
##### 1. Base Image
Our choice for the base image will likely be influenced by the target application's technical requirements.
IE;
- With a Symfony, Laravel, I have an application dependency on PHP
- With a React, Vue, I have an application dependency on Node
- With a Springboot, I have an application dependency on Java

If your application requires a more custom environment then this can be achived by using OS images a base which we then configure to our needs!  



##### 2. Runtime Configuration
